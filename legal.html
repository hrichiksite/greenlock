		<h1>Greetings!</h1>

		<p>
			I, AJ ONeal, am not a big fan of legalize, but I am a fan of communicating
			clearly. I hope that this accomplish both defining some legal boundaries
			as well as communicating in a friendly and clear way, at least to the
			degree that suits our needs for the current stage of our products and
			services.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is important because it is our intent to create sustainable open
			source projects, which means that we do want to create brand value, grow
			community, and, eventually, be able to work full time on creating more
			great software and services.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you'd like to contact me, especially if you feel that I (or we) have
			made a mistake in how we operate, please do so:
		</p>

				<a href="https://jshaver.net">John</a>, &amp; Josh</em

			(collectively <a href="https://therootcompany.com">Root</a>) for automated

		<p>
			Greenlock Domains is an important product / service combo to us because
			it's a huge milestone on the path to a more decentralized web. We believe
			in
			<em>ownership</em> and <em>control</em> and we're building a
			<a href="https://therootcompany.com">Home Server</a> because we envision a
			world in which everyone is empowered to make the choice of whether to rent
			or own their stuff.
		</p>

		<p>
			If we don't do this, well, with the way the cloud is headed, renting may
			be the only option in the future.
		</p>

		<p>We need <em>Root</em> because we want ownership.</p>

		<p>
			If at any time you feel that any of our messaging or practices are in
			conflict with our mission or these values, please let us know.
		</p>

		<h1 id="licensing">Licensing</h1>

		<p>
			Each of our products comes with its own LICENSE file and the license(s)
			may alse be in some sort of manifest file (such as package.json).
		</p>

		<p>
			We typically use the MIT and Apache-2.0 licenses for libraries that we
			actively want others to copy, modify, use and redistribute.
		</p>

		<p>
			We typically use ISC and MPL-2.0 with products for which we're a little
			more concerned about branding or about which we have particularly strong
			opinions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Although we do keep some of our software proprietary and we do use
			trademarks, because we believe in empowerment and choice we do our best to
			provide usable self-service forms of our products and services for
			personal use.
		</p>

		<p>
			If at any time you feel that our Licensing is in conflict with our mission
			or values, please let us know.
		</p>

		<h1 id="terms">Terms of Service</h1>

		<p>
			We want to make the world a better place. Everyone has a different
			definition of what "a better place" means, so the purpose of our terms is
			to rule out some things that we think makes the world (and particularly
			our world) a worse place:
		</p>

		<p>
			You agree that you will use the Greenlock&trade; service, code, libraries,
			documentation, etc (provided by <a href="#greenlock">us</a>) primarily for
			securing network connections for yourself, your customers, on your and
			your customer's devices on internets, intranets, and... other nets.
		</p>

		<p>
			You agree that you will take reasonable measures to keep up-to-date with
			security releases.
		</p>

		<p>
			You agree to not use our products or services in a way that would cause
			unusual or undue burden on our servers or services, our partners servers
			or services, or our customers servers or services, or in a way that harms
			or misrepresents the reputation or brand value (including causing brand
			confusion) of the aforementioned parties (or really anybody).
		</p>

		<p>
			This is not to say that you can't publicly have a negative opinion, but
			don't bite the hand that feeds and don't be vicious or misrepresentative.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you have a use case that may be in violation of these terms
			(particularly the part about undue burden), but you feel contributes to
			making the world a better place, we're here to help (assuming it also
			aligns with our values). Although it may not be appropriate to use our
			services, but perhaps we can help you with a solution based on our
			no-cost, low-cost or open source products.
		</p>

		<p>
			If at any time you feel that our Terms of Service are in conflict with our
			mission or values, please let us know.
		</p>

		<h1 id="trademark">Trademark</h1>

		<p>
			"Greenlock" and the "green G lock" mark are Trademarks of
			<a href="https://coolaj86.com" target="_blank">AJ ONeal</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			We'll be coming out with a brand guide as to how you should use the marks.
			In the meantime: don't change the proportions, colors (excepting the case
			of greyscale and black and white).
		</p>

		<p>
			It is appropriate to use the trademark in a way that promotes the brand
			with proper attribution, linking to the official project repositories,
			etc.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is appropriate use the name greenlock in a plugin for Greenlock&trade;,
			as long as it is clear that it is a community contribution.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you create a "hard" fork of our code or any products or services, you
			should give your fork its own name, and not use ours. That sound, we
			gladly welcome your suggestiosn and pull requests.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you mirror our code you should make it clear that it is a mirror and
			link to the official repository. in association with usand the disclose
			that you use Greenlock
		</p>

		<p>
			If at any time you feel that our Trademark policies are in conflict with
			our values, please let us know.
		</p>

		<h1 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h1>

		<p>What we collect and (more importantly) <em>Why</em>:</p>

		<p><strong>Name</strong>:</p>
		<p>
			In the cases that we collect your name, it's because we want to know how
			to address you. All four of us want to be personable if and when we reach
			out.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Email</strong>:</p>
		<p>
			There are three main purposes for which we may use your email address:
		</p>

		<p>
			1. A one-time outreach to ask if you were able to do what you intended to
			do. We want to make a great product. Although open source projects
			traditionally have a <em>reactive</em> approach to communication (i.e. you
			file a bug and wait for a response), we believe that creating sustainable
			open source requires a <em>proactive</em> approach.
		</p>

		<p>
			2. Security and legal notifications. It's important that we have a way to
			contact you if we've made a mistake or discover a mistake that needs to be
			addressed. This may include vulnerabilities as well as mandatory upgrades
			(such as when a significant change to the Let's Encrypt API is made).
			Making sure that our products work and are secure aligns with our values
			and contributes to our brand identity.
		</p>

		<p>
			3. Opt-in updates. Many of you want to know when we have significant
			feature updates or when we have something that we believe is really
			valuable to share. We've created an opt-in avenue for that. And you can
			always opt-out as well.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Telemetry</strong>:</p>
		<p>
			We believe that the current open source model needs improvement - it often
			relies heavily on large centralized platforms which aggregate a lot of
			user information for the platform without appropriately targeting the
			relationship between authors and users of projcts (i.e. npm, github, etc).
			We believe that making open source sustainable means a greater focus on
			empowering authors and users. We've learned from other projects (Caddy,
			Heroku, and others) which use telemetry as part of a proactive approach to
			open source and we believe that it can be a great avenue for us to be
			proactive as well.
		</p>

		<p>
			We may use telemetry about operating system, browser, node version, code
			version, and other system-level information to better understand how we
			can serve our users (you) and proactively solve problems that we might not
			otherwise hear about. For example, if we see many page visits in a certain
			browser (or installs with a new version of node), but few successful
			registrations, we know that something is wrong.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Other</strong>:</p>
		<p>
			We also use Google Analytics on our web sites for basic functionality.
			Other than that, nothing else comes to mind right now. As we consider what
			we will do in the future, it will be measured against our mission and
			values. We never want to come across as spammy or forceful. We want to do
			things that help us build our brand, acknowledge our customers; things
			that are proactive, and that promote sustainable source.
		</p>

		<p>
			If at any time you feel that our Privacy policy is in conflict with our
			mission or values, please let us know.
